## Multi-tier Web Application Deployment

This project involves the entire process of setting up the project, starting from the local setup and extending all the way to the cloud.


## Project Description

This project encompasses multiple applications and is initially set up locally.

Architecture of Project Services

NGINX | TOMCAT | RABBITMQ | MEMCACHED | MYSQL

The project is organized into distinct branches within the repository, with each branch representing a different phase:

1. Localsetup Branch: This branch focuses on setting up the multi-tier web application locally. It involves configuring and fine-tuning the various services, including NGINX, TOMCAT, RABBITMQ, MEMCACHED, and MYSQL.

2. LiftandShift Branch: After completing the local setup, the project transitions to the lift and shift phase. In this branch, the application is migrated from the local environment to the cloud infrastructure, ensuring all components are properly deployed and functional.

3. Refactor Branch: Once the lift and shift phase is complete, the project moves to the refactor branch. Here, the services are optimized and redesigned to enhance performance, scalability, or other specific requirements. This phase may involve making architectural changes or adopting new technologies.

4. CI-Jenkins Branch: The CI-Jenkins branch is dedicated to implementing continuous integration using tools like Jenkins, Nexus, Sonarqube, and Slack. This branch focuses on establishing a robust CI pipeline that automates build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring efficient collaboration and code quality.

5. CI-AWS Branch: The CI-AWS branch integrates continuous integration into AWS CodePipeline, taking advantage of the cloud-native CI/CD capabilities. This branch streamlines the deployment process, enabling seamless delivery and monitoring of new features and updates.

By organizing the project into separate branches, each representing a specific phase, it becomes easier to manage and track progress while maintaining clear separation of concerns for each aspect of the project."
